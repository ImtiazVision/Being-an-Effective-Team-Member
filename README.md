# Being-an-Effective-Team-Member


#### Prioritize team objectives and foster trust

Prioritize the needs of the team before our own. Our needs will not always coincide with those of the team. In such instances, we must exercise accommodation and flexibility in order to satisfy the demands of the team. We develop trust by putting the team first.
