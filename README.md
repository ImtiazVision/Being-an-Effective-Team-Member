# Being-an-Effective-Team-Member


### Prioritize team objectives and foster trust

Prioritize the needs of the team before our own. Our needs will not always coincide with those of the team. In such instances, we must exercise accommodation and flexibility in order to satisfy the demands of the team. We develop trust by putting the team first.

### Reliable teammates are effective colleagues

A good team requires dependability. Team members are expected to uphold their promises and provide outcomes. Members of the team therefore encouraged to follow the philosophy of underpromise and overdeliver. Our projects' key status updates should be shared within the team membersÂ on a regular basis.

### Exhibiting Positivity

We ought to highlight our colleagues' qualities while abstaining from gossiping in order to maintain a good mindset by avoiding complaining and seeking positivism.
